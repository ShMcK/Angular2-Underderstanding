Angular2 Typescript
===================

Transpile Typescript files ending with '.ng.ts' and '.ts' to ES5.

This package uses typescript 1.5.3 with all the additions to support Angular2 syntax.

Angular2 TS Files must have the extension `ng.ts` so the compiler can add the System.register code for angular2.
