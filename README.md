# Ng2-Understanding

Demos to help myself understand Angular 2 better.

But hey, you can look at it, too.

## Outline

* props-attrs-test (SOLVED, only slightly hacky)
 - How does a parent component pass properties to a child component through attributes?
 
* parent-child
 - How does Parent() Child(target) communication work in Angular 2?
 
* forms
 - ng-model
 - Control, Control-Group, NgFormModel
 - FormBuilder (NOT WORKING)

* Pipes
 - basic filters
 - observables (INCOMPLETE)
 
* Events
 - Event Emitter

* Directives
 - host events
 - change host element (TODO)

##### Todo

* dependency injection
* shadow-dom + styles
* lifecycles
* testing
